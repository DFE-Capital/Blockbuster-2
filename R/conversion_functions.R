#' Convert blockbuster_pds_data sample into block level wide format
#'
#' Provide a block-level summary of an element-level data frame.  Repair costs
#' at each grade are summed and the cost-effectiveness ratio (repair/rebuild) is
#' computed.
#' @param pds A data frame containing the element-level data.
#' @param block.rebuild.cost The unit cost to rebuild 1 sq.m.
#' @details block.rebuild.cost is used to compute the estimated cost of
#' rebuilding.  The formula used is block.rebuild.cost x gifa (Gross Internal
#' Floor Area).
#'
#' @return A block level wide format table for use with blockbuster v2
#' @examples
#' # Summarise the element-level PDS.data at block level with a Â£5,000 unit
#' # rebuild cost.
