#' Rebuild blocks by adjusting the block- and element-level data frames
#'
#' This function simulates rebuilding by changing all component blocks to grade
#' A in rebuilt blocks.  The output is an element-level data frame and only the
#' grade probabilities are changed. The repair costs are not updated in this
#' function. It is therefore important to run \code{\link{UpdateElementRepairs}}
#' and \code{\link{UpdateBlockRepairs}} on the element- and block-level data
#' frames respectively after calling this function, and in that order too.
#'
#' The decision about which blocks to rebuild is made based on a measure of
#' cost-effectiveness, the ratio between the cost to repair all components in a
#' block and the cost to rebuild the entire block.  The rebuild cost is
#' estimated using the unit rebuild cost times the Gross Internal Floor Area
#' (GIFA) of the block.
#'
#' After eliminating all zero rebuild cost block from consideration (to save
#' computational time), the blocks are ordered in descending order of
#' cost effectiveness.  If there is enough money then the first block is
#' repaired, then the second, and so on, skipping blocks if there are not
#' enough funds.  This continues until either there are no blocks left to
#' rebuild or not enough money to rebuild any remaining blocks.
#'
#' @param element.data An element-level data-frame.
#' @param block.data A block-level data-frame.
#' @param rebuild.money A number
#'
#' @return An element-level data frame with updated grade proportions for
#' rebuilt blocks.  Note that repair costs are not updated, nor the
#' block-level data frame holding block-level information so
#' \code{\link{UpdateElementRepairs}} and \code{\link{UpdateBlockRepairs}}
#' should be run afterwards.
#' @examples
#' # Rebuild blocks with budget of Â£1M
#' rebuilt_elements <- blockbuster2:::Rebuild(simulated_elements, simulated_blocks, 1e6)
#' # IMPORTANT - This does not update the repair costs so you need to pass
#' # the results to UpdateElementRepairs
#' rebuilt_elements <- blockbuster2:::UpdateElementRepairs(rebuilt_elements)
#' # Also update the block-level costs
#' rebuild_blocks <- blockbuster2:::UpdateBlockRepairs(simulated_blocks, rebuilt_elements)

#' Rebuild all elements in the given blocks.

#' 1 for all blocks identified in the vector \code{buildingids} and sets all
#' grades to 0 while not changing the grades of blocks not in
#' \code{buildingids}.
#' @param element.data An element-level data frame.
#' @param buildingids A numeric vector identifying the \code{buildingid} keys of
#' the blocks to rebuild.
#'
#' @return An element-level data frame with updated grades.
#' @examples
#' # Rebuild the block with buildingid 11

#' Find blocks to rebuild within budget recursively.
#'
#' An efficient recursive algorithm used by \code{\link{Rebuild}} that outputs
#' the \code{keys} corresponding to the unique combination of elements in the
#' ordered vector \code{vec} that sum to less than \code{budget}.
#'
#' The \code{vec} and \code{keys} arguments are split into two.  The sum of the
#' first half of \code{vec} is compared to the budget.  If it is less then all
#' keys are selected, otherwise, the argument is split in half again and checked,
#' and so on.  Afterwards, the second half is checked if there are still monies
#' to spend.
#'
#' @param vec A numeric vector. When called by \code{\link{Rebuild}} this
#' contains the cost of rebuilding blocks.
#' @param keys A vector. When called by \code{\link{Rebuild}} this contains the
#' \code{buildingids} associated with the costs in \code{vec}.
#' @param budget A number.
#' @param state (optional) This holds the selected keys during recursion.
#' @return A list.  \code{.$state} holds the selected keys while \code{.$budget}
#' holds the unused budget.
#' @examples
#' # Ten buildings have rebuild costs between one to ten. Spend 12 to rebuild
#' # the first four
#' blockbuster2:::RecursiveBudgeting(1:10, 1:10, 12)
#' # If the costs are reversed, the decision changes as the vector is ordered
