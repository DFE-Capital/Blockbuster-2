Description: This R package allows you to simulate the deterioration of school
    buildings through time using a discrete time markov chain.The data were
    collected during the Property Data Survey Programme (PDSP) of 2012-2014.
    Approximately 2.7 million rows of data were collected. This provides the
    initial state of the School Estate at time zero. The deterioration of the 
    School Estate is modelled using deterioration rates associated with each 
    building component. Rebuilding and repairing of the School Estate is
    simulated with simple decision making about what to rebuild/repair at each
    timestep.
